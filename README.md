# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation

This project is done to create customer segmentation based on transaction behavior in the last 6 months. The segmentation results can be used by credit card owners as a reference for providing attractive offers to customers according to their segments. This is expected to maintain customer loyalty. The segmentation results can also be used to map who is a customer so that the bank can determine a marketing strategy to find new customers.

Developed a machine learning project utilizing clustering KMeans algorithm to make customer segmentation
from credit card customer, based on historical transaction data, and made 3 clusters of customers.
